        Funny story
    </h4>
    <p class="story">
    One day i took my mom shopping, and i parked the car 50 meters before the shop because the parking was full.
    As people were leaving the shop, i drove slowly forward until i got in front of the shop.
    In front of me was a car exactly like mine. My mother came out of the shop and didn't realize that i was the second
    car, she went directly to the first one and wanted to get in. That car was locked and she was wondering were did i go.
    After a few seconds of looking for me, she saw my car and me inside it laughing.
